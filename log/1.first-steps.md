# Welcome to Kodiak!

## Comments

Comments are one of the most important features of any programming language. They allow you to add notes to your code that will be ignored by the compiler. Comments can be used to explain what your code is doing, to document your code, or to disable code temporarily.

In Kodiak, comments are denoted in two ways: single-line comments and multi-line comments. Single-line comments start with `{?}` and continue until the end of the line. Multi-line comments start with `{?` and end with `?}`.

```kodiak
{?} Here's a single-line comment.

{? And
   here is a
     multi-line comment.
?}
```

## Variables

There are two kinds of variables in Kodiak: `var` and `val`. `var` variables can be reassigned, while `val` variables cannot.

```kodiak
var x :int = 10
set x :int = 20

val y :int = 10
set y :int = 20 {?} Error.
```

Notice the use of `set` to reassign a `var` variable.

## Functions

Here's how you define a function in Kodiak:

```kodiak
fn max (a :int, b :int) :int => {
  if a > b then a
  else b
}
```

Sometimes the Kodiak compiler will infer the type of a variable based on its value. For example, the following code is valid:

```kodiak
fn max(a :int, b :int) => if a > b then a else b
```

Once you've defined a function, you can call it by name:

```kodiak
var bigger = max(3, 5) {?} 5
```

Here's the definition of a function that doesn't take any parameters and returns no interesting result:

```kodiak
fn greet() :unit => {
  printline("[Hello, world!])
}
```

## Control flow

### `while`/`if`

In Kodiak, `while` and `if` statements are used to control the flow of execution. `while` statements repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true, while `if` statements execute a block of code if a condition is true.

```kodiak
fn main(..args: :[text]) =>
  var i = 0
  while i < args.length do
    if i != 0 then
      print("[ ])
    print(args[i])
    set i += 1
  printline()
```

While we can use the indentation based syntax, we can also use the curly braces syntax:

```kodiak
fn main(..args :[text]) => {
  var i = 0;
  while (i < args.length) {
    if (i != 0) {
      print("[ ]);
    }
    print(args[i]);
    set i += 1;
  }
  printline();
}
```

### `for` and `foreach`

```kodiak
fn main(..args :[text]) =>
  args.foreach(arg => printline(arg))
```

```kodiak
fn main(..args :[text]) =>
  args.foreach(printline)
```

```kodiak
fn main(..args :[text]) =>
  for arg :text = args do
    printline(arg)
```

```kodiak
fn main(..args :[text]) => {
  for (let arg :text in args) {
    printline(arg);
  };
};
```
